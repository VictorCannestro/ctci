"""
Implement a `CircularArray` class that supports an array-like data structure
which can be efficiently rotated. If possible the class should use a generic 
type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard
`for (Obj o: circularArray)` notation--i.e. an enhaced for loop in Java.
