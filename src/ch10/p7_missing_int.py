"""
Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an 
algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you 
have 1 GB of memory available for the task.


FOLLOW UP
What if you have only 10 MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct
and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.
